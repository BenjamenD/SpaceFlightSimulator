# Orbital Command: Realistic Space Flight Simulator

*A Unity-powered 3D space flight simulation experience designed to closely replicate the challenges of real-world spaceflight training.*

## Overview
**Space Flight Simulator** is a realistic 3D space flight simulator built in **Unity (C#)**. It’s designed to emulate authentic spaceflight conditions, challenging players to manage complex systems such as **fuel, oxygen, temperature, and navigation** while completing high-stakes missions.

Unlike arcade-style space games, Orbital Command focuses on **realistic physics, orbital mechanics, and resource management**, giving players a true taste of the precision and strategy behind space operations.

## Key Features
- **Realistic Spaceflight Physics**
  - Accurate simulation of orbital mechanics, inertia, and gravity wells.
  - Thruster-based movement, including rotational and translational controls.
  - Dynamic temperature and energy modeling when operating near stars or planets.

- **System Management**
  - **Fuel Management**: Balance thruster movement carefully to completing missions with tight control rather than reckless flying.
  - **Oxygen Systems**: Monitor O₂ reserves, ensuring missions are completed within the time limit they impose.
  - **Thermal Control**: Prevent overheating near stars by managing distance to stars as well as rotation in relation to them.

- **Mission Types**
  - **Orbital Docking**: Execute precise maneuvers to dock with satelites and ships.
  - **Payload Transport**: Move cargo across orbital paths without destabilizing orbits.
  - **Planetary Landing**: Navigate atmospheric re-entry to dock with planetary stations.
  - **Exploration & Survey**: Complete scanning missions while staying within strict fuel and oxygen limits.
